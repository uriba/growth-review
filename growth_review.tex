\section*{Abstract}


\paragraph*{
In many microorganisms, the expression of a large fraction of the genome appears to be coordinately regulated with growth rate.
However, although cellular growth rates, gene expression levels and gene regulation have been at the center of biological research for decades, recently there has been renewed interest in their quantitative interdependence.
Here, we review recently published theoretical and experimental work in the field.
We suggest a simplistic model, originating from the classic work of the Copenhagen school, that is useful as a quantitative benchmark on the interdependence of gene regulation, protein levels and growth rate.
Based on an accumulated body of work we suggest that many of the gene expression changes observed across different environmental conditions are the result of passive redistribution of limited cellular resources, and are quantitatively reflected by the growth rate.
This work emphasizes the extent to which gene expression can be modulated, even without employing specific regulation.

\section*{Introduction}

The Introduction should be succinct and provide only the necessary
background information, rather than a comprehensive review of the
specific field. It should not contain subheadings.


\section*{Results}

In articles, each section should be divided by subheadings and may
be combined into one section if appropriate. Citations should be formatted
in the Author-Year style using the natbib latex package. A bibtex
style file is supplied with this template, and should be used. Here
are some sample citations (\citealp{Bailey2006,Elgar2008b,Gill1991,Gregory2005,Hufton2009,Kikuta2007,Mishra2006,Ohno1970,Straehle2008a,Tate2005,Woolfe2007a,Gregory2005a,Baba2006,Lemberger2010,Sneppen2008}). 


\section*{Discussion}

Results and Discussion sections should be combined in the Report format. 


\section*{Materials and methods}

This section should contain sufficient detail so that all experimental
procedures can be repeated by others, in conjunction with cited references.
Authors should also provide clear and complete descriptions of the
metrics applied for quality assessment and validation of their datasets
and the computational tools used for data analysis. Molecular Systems
Biology encourages detailed descriptions of methodology or additional
materials to be included as Supplementary information. This information
should, however, not be of immediate importance for the understanding
of the manuscript.


\section*{Acknowledgements}

Personal acknowledgements should precede those of institutions or
agencies.
